Project Title: Labelling Fashion Items - CNN for Image Classification 
Description: Developed a CNN using TensorFlow and Keras libraries for image classification. The model architecture consisted of Multiple convolutional layers with ReLU activation, followed by max pooling layers. The output of the convolutional layers were flattened and fed into a dense layer with five output nodes representing the five classes (Glasses,Sunglasses,Trousers,Jeans,Shoes). The model was compiled with Adam optimizer and Sparse Categorical Crossentropy loss function. 
Hyperparameter tuning was performed by adjusting the number of filters and filter size. The model was trained on a training dataset and evaluated on a validation dataset using early stopping to prevent overfitting.
 TensorBoard and Confusion Matrix callbacks were used to monitor the training process and visualize the performance of the model. The code also includes functions for generating and logging the confusion matrix. The trained model achieved an accuracy of 99% on the validation set, and 98% on the test set.
